%% This simple example finds alternatives (synonyms)
%% for words that share the same hypernym. However,
%% two words could share a hypernym, though they are not
%% related at all. This happens, if they refer to the 
%% same word (hypernym), but to different senses.
%% Thus it's necessary to cross-check, if the two words are
%% indeed hyponyms of this hypernym in the same sense.
%%
%% Example:
%% "calendar" and "dresser" have the same hypernym "table"
%% However, they should not be regarded as relatives, since
%% they refere to different senses of "table".

%% word()     input
%% relevant() input, augmented by relevant sense number
%% more()     output
%% 
%% we consider only nouns in this example

%% the input:
words("calendar").
words("contents").
words("dresser").
%% find the hypernyms ...
hypernyms(W,SS,H) :- &wordnet[2,W](1,SS,H,_), words(W).

%% ... and the hyponyms of the hypernyms for
%% sense cross-checking:
hwords(H) :- hypernyms(_,_,H).
hyponyms(W,SS,H) :- &wordnet[3,W](1,SS,H,_), hwords(W).

%% determine relevant senses (sense cross-checking):
%% (if two words have the same hypernym, then this
%% hypernym should have both words as hyponyms in
%% the same sense)
relevant(W1,S1) :- hypernyms(W1,S1,H), hypernyms(W2,S2,H), W1!=W2, hyponyms(H,HS,W1), hyponyms(H,HS,W2).

%% find synonyms of relevant senses:
%% (this step might be the same for 
%% all these kinds of applications)
more(M) :- &wordnet[23,W](1,S,M,_), relevant(W,S).

%% optional: add the hypernym (or whatever 
%% the common relative was) itself to more():
more(M) :- hypernyms(W,S,M), relevant(W,S).
